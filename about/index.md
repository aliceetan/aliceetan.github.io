<center>I am a junior at Pomona College majoring in computer science and economics. While CS is my main focus at school, I have developed a strong interest in psychology and health/wellness. What really fascinates me within the world of computer science is the social impact of technology and how we as a community are influenced by its developments. I also love talking to people so reach out if you want to chat about anything ! </center>

## This is me 
* love tea and cookies
